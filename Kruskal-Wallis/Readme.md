# 📊 ANOVA & Kruskal-Wallis

❕**DISCLAIMER:** As my thesis and its results is not publically available, I have randomized my data. The numerical variables in the data are completely randomized to protect the actual results and conclusions of my thesis. To conclude, these results are based on fictional data and hence the results and conclusions presented here should not be considered cientifically accurate.❕
