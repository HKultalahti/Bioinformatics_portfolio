So here is my basic guide to Python.

## Different type of lines 

### str
Str means text 
It need to be inside " " or ' '
When used with print command it looks like this

text = "I like cats"
print(text)       # this prints the text we assigned above
print("I like cats") # you can also do it like this


## Commands

| Command  | What it does | Important |
| ------------- | ------------- |-------|
| print(" ")  | prints the wanted text  | print("text") vs print (2+2) and spaces in text|
| input(" ")  | gets info from user  |
