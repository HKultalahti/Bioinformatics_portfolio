## What is a Manhattan plot?
Manhattan plot is a scatter plot that shows (in the big picture) how SNPs 

## p -value and hypothesis in GWAS
It is crucial to understand, what the p -value means. In this case, *a lower p -value suggests a 

So the question when calculating p -value could be put into words like this 
*"What are the chances, we can find as significant or more significant connection between a SNP and a phenotype 

H0 (null hypothesis) = SNP has no connection to phenotype
H1 (alternative hypothesis) =  SNP has a connection to phenotype

Once again back to understanding the p -value. So if the SNP has no meaning as far as the phenotype is concerned, the chances of getting as significant or more significant
