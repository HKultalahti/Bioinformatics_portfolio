# Bioinformatics_portfolio
Welcome to my bioinformatics portfolio! 

I‚Äôm a Master of Science in Genetics and Molecular Biology (University of Oulu), specialized in bioinformatics and virology. This repository contais pieces of my bioinformatic master's thesis "Muurahaisten RNA-viruskirjon kartoittaminen" (Mapping of the ant RNA virome) that demonstrate my skills in data analysis, scripting, and biological interpretation. My thesis is not publically available but can be read by request.

## üî¨ Areas of expertise
- *De novo transcriptome analysis from RNA-seq data*
  ‚Üí pipeline development using Lazypipe, including QC, assembly, and annotation

- *High-performance computing (HPC)*
  ‚Üí batch jobs, resource management and shell scripting in SLURM environment on Puhti

- *Contig filtering and curation*
  ‚Üí post-processing with CAP3, quality-based contig selection

- *Gene and ORF annotation*
  ‚Üí open reading frame prediction (NCBI ORF Finder), BLAST-based homology annotation

- *Statistical analysis*
  ‚Üí linear regression, ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis test, Shapiro-Wilk normality testing, homoscedasticity testing
  
- *Data analysis and visualization*
  ‚Üí summary statistics, distribution analysis, and various visualizations including Q‚ÄìQ plots, boxplots, scatter plots, and **currently creating a folder for a Manhattan plot** using Rstudio and ggplot2

- *Command-line tools & scripting*
  ‚Üí efficient use of bioinformatics tools in Unix environment

- *Scientific reporting and interpretation*
  ‚Üí integrating biological insight with computational results in a thesis context

## üß† About me

I'm a recent M.Sc. graduate in Genetics and Molecular Biology from the University of Oulu, Finland, with a strong focus on bioinformatics. I completed my thesis as part of a Ant Genomics and Immunity research group (lead by PhD Lumi Viljakainen), analyzing ant RNAseq data using high-throughput RNA-seq and de novo assembly pipelines. My work involved using the Lazypipe workflow on the CSC Puhti supercomputer, post-processing contigs, functional annotation, statistical analysis, and data visualization.

In addition to my thesis, I completed my master's degree internship in Seppo Vainio's research group in Biocenter Oulu, where I conducted primary cell culture of human skin keratinocyte cells and performed various analysis such as Western blot and qPCR.

I am currently actively seeking opportunities in bioinformatics, computational biology, or related science data analysis roles. I'm passionate about applying computational tools to solve biological questions and continuously developing my skills in programming, data science, and genomics.
