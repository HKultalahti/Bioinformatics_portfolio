📚*To teach is the best way to learn*

So here is my basic guide to Python.

## Different type of lines 

### String (str)
Str means text
It need to be inside " " or ' '
When used with print command it looks like this

````
```
text = "I like cats"
print(text)       # this prints the text we assigned above
print("I like cats") # you can also do it like this
```
````

### Numerical values (int, float)
It looks like this

integer = 5
decimal = 3.14
print(integer)  # 5
print(decimal)  # 3.14

* When printing both text and numbers, you need to do have some tricks up your slveeve *


## Commands

| Command  | What it does | Important |
| ------------- | ------------- |-------|
| print(" ")  | prints the wanted text  | print("text") vs print (2+2) and spaces in text|
| input(" ")  | gets info from user  |
