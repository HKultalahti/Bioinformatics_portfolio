## SLURM & bash scripting

In my master's thesis "Muurahaisten RNA -viruskirjon kartoittaminen"(Mapping of the ant RNA virome)(Not publicly available but can be shared upon request) 
I used CSC’s Puhti supercomputing environment to run large-scale RNA-seq analyses.
I executed multiple batch jobs using SLURM and Bash scripting, processing transcriptomic data from 66 ant species with a bioinformatic pipeline desined for virus and bateria detection, called Lazypipe.
This involved running automated workflows that performed quality control, de novo assembly, and annotation of RNA-seq and reference genome data efficiently in parallel computing environments.

# Through this work, I became comfortable with:

- Navigating Linux-based systems

- Writing and submitting batch scripts

- Managing job dependencies and computational resources

- Monitoring and troubleshooting jobs in large-scale analyses¨

# Puhti HPC example scripts

This folder contains example scripts demonstrating batch jobs and analyses I have performed on the Puhti supercomputer. I share these only for demonstration purposes.
