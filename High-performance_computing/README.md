# High-performance computing (HPC) skills

## SLURM & bash scripting

In my master's thesis "Muurahaisten RNA -viruskirjon kartoittaminen"(Mapping of the ant RNA virome)(Not publicly available but can be shared upon request) I used CSCâ€™s Puhti supercomputing environment to run large-scale RNA-seq analyses.
I executed multiple batch jobs using SLURM and Bash scripting, processing transcriptomic data from 66 ant species with the Lazypipe pipeline.
This involved running automated workflows that performed quality control, de novo assembly, and annotation of RNA-seq and reference genome data efficiently in parallel computing environments.

Through this work, I became comfortable with:

Navigating Linux-based systems

Writing and submitting batch scripts

Managing job dependencies and computational resources

Monitoring and troubleshooting jobs in large-scale analyses
