## 📋 Manual for Western blot by Syeda Tayyiba Rahat & Henna Kultalahti

Shared in this folder is a pdf file of a western blot protocol that I have used many times when performing WB. The manual is originally made by Seyda Tayyiba Rahat but the shared version has edits and additional info by me.

>[!NOTE]
> I share this WB protocol for skill demonstration purposes only. Sharing this demonstrates how I understand the methods and acts as a proof of my lab skills.
