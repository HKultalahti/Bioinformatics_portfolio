# Fictional Data for Portfolio

This folder contains fictional data created for demonstrating my data analysis skills.
The datasets are fully synthetic and do not contain any real patient information.

- ** portfolio_patients.csv **
      demographic and clinical information (age, sex, comorbidities, virus status, treatment, and outcome).

portfolio_labs.csv – laboratory measurements over multiple visits (PCR Ct, CRP, WBC).

portfolio_genetics.csv – simplified genetic data (SNPs, polygenic risk score, and gene expression features).

These datasets can be used for:

SQL queries (e.g., JOINs, GROUP BY, filtering)

Statistical analyses in Python or R

Data visualization and reporting

All data is fictional and intended for portfolio demonstration purposes only.
