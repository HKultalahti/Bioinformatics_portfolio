# 📊 ANOVA & Kruskal-Wallis

Here I demonstrate my skills with statistical analysis methods ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis. This example (including R scripts) is for demonstration purposes only. The theme and variables are from my master's thesis "Muurahaisten RNA-viruskirjon kartoitus" (Mapping of the ant RNA virome).

❕**DISCLAIMER:** As my thesis and its results is not publically available, I have randomized my data. The numerical variables in the data are completely randomized to protect the actual results and conclusions of my thesis. To conclude, these results are based on fictional data and hence the results and conclusions presented here should not be considered cientifically accurate.❕

## Why perform ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis


## Example

In my example here, we have a data consisting of:
- ant species, we know the size of the colony (small, medium or large) they were collected from
- how many virus species we have found in each ant species trough lazypipe analysis

**Research question = Is there a correlation between colony size and number of virus species found?**
**Hypothesis = The bigger the colony, the more viruses are found**
