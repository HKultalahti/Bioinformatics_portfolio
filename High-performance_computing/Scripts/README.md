## lazypipe_batch_job.slurm

This SLURM batch script demonstrates how to make a sbatch command and run Lazypipe for ant RNA-seq data for virus detection analysis on the CSC Puhti supercomputer.
It loads the required software modules, allocates computing resources (time, memory, and CPU cores), and executes Lazypipe for a single ant RNA-seq sample using ant reference genome that I provided.

### What happens in the script:

1. Resource allocation:
The #SBATCH lines define the job name, runtime, memory, and number of cores for the batch job.

2. Environment setup:
Loads the required modules (r-env-singularity, biokit, and lazypipe) for running the pipeline.

3. Output structure:
Creates directories for log files and analysis results.

4. Execution:
Runs Lazypipe on one paired-end RNA-seq sample (GAGA-0366) against its reference genome using defined input and output paths.

5. Logging:
Uses echo commands to track job progress, which are saved to the output log file generated by Puhti.

This example represents the workflow I used during my master’s thesis to process large-scale ant RNA-seq datasets in a high-performance computing environment.
