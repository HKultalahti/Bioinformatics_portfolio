# ®️ R skills & scripts for visualization


**🍒 Notice, that R scripts for statistical analyses you can find in folders [Kruskal-Walllis](../Kruskal-Wallis/) & [Linear_regression](../Linear_regression/)**


Here I demonstrate my skills with R and share scripts for visualizations.

❕DISCLAIMER: As my thesis and its results is not publically available (available by request), I have randomized my data. The numerical variables in the data are completely randomized to protect the actual results and conclusions of my thesis. To conclude, the visualizations and results and conclusions presented here should not be considered scientifically accurate.❕

## 🐜 Example 1: Boxplot

Script in this folder: portfolio_boxplot
Script [here](portfolio_boxplot)

Boxplot is good when wanting to visualize categorical variables and numerical variables. Here I present to you a boxplot showing 3 different sized colonies and the amount of different virus species found in them. 

## 🐜 Example 2: Scatterplot
